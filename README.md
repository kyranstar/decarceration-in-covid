# Decarceration During COVID-19

There are over 86,000 inmates in the US with COVID-19 and 8 out of 10 of the top case clusters are in US prisons. As the pandemic has spread to every corner of the United States, the US prison system has become an dire situation due to close proximity, slow response, low testing, and low sanitation standards.

We propose a new decarceration and reintegration plan that houses homeless decarcerated people in hotels, and provides minimum wage jobs in industries damaged by the pandemic on a prison payroll.

We have found that providing hotel housing and jobs protects decarcerated people as well as protecting industries damaged by the pandemic - and, in many cases, reduces costs for prisons.
